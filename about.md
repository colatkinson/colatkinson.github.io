I'm a student at Sleepy Hollow High School. My hobbies include programming, playing the trumpet, and fencing.

I'm the co-founder and co-president of the [Sleepy Hollow Computer Coding Club](https://shhs-coding-club.github.io/).

For some of my projects, see the appropriate page, or check out my GitHub.
