I'm a software engineer at [Atakama](https://atakama.com), working primarily on the userspace filesystem and OS interface integration.

I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Spring 2018 with a B.S. in computer science.

My interests include cryptography, distributed systems, and overoptimizing my code for no damn reason.
